Do you feel this —  
the substance of something really there,  
really, really good, and really fine?  

Do you feel the love?  
Do you know from whence it came?  
I have been searching long for such a feeling,  
and I found it  
between you and me.  

Can you feel the love?  
Can you hear the sound —  
in my heart, and in my hopes?  
Can you possibly know what it is?  

Is this real?  
Or is this true?  
Do you know?  

Right in between you and me,  
in the distance between  
your fears and my hesitations,  
I found it there —  
playing with my mind —  
and it showed me your smile.  

That’s it! I fell,  
knocked down with love.  
I’ve been in delight ever since.  

Is this real love... or what?
