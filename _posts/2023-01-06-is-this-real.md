do you feel this substance  
of something really there  
really really good and really fine    

do you feel the love  
do you know from whence it came  

I have been searching long for such a feeling  
this is exactly what I was looking for  
and I found it in between you and me  

can you feel the love  
can you hear the sound  
in my heart and in my hopes  
can you possibly know what it is  

is this real  
or is this true  
do you know  

right in between you and me  
in the distance in between  
your fears and my hesitations  
I found it there playing with my mind  
and it showed me your smile  

that's it! I fell  
knocked down with love  
I've been in delight ever since  
 
do you know what's in those eyes  
when I look very close to you  
my face warmed up in another world  
can you tell me what you see whithin  

is this real love... or what?
